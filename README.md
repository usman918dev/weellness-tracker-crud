## How Reminders & Notifications Work

### In-App Reminders (Browser Notifications)
- Browser notifications are scheduled using JavaScript timers and the Notification API.
- Default reminder times are set for each wellness type (see `src/lib/reminderService.js`).
- When the user visits the app, call `requestNotificationPermission()` and then `scheduleReminders()` to enable reminders.
- Example notification: ‚ÄúTime to drink some water! üíß‚Äù

### Email Reminders (Backend Ready)
- The backend is set up to send email reminders using `nodemailer`.
- Fill out the email settings in `.env.local`.
- You can add a cron job or serverless function to send emails at user-preferred times.

## Customization

- **Add more wellness types:** Extend the `WellnessLog` model and update the UI.
- **Change chart types:** Update Chart.js config in each dashboard page.
- **Add more notification options:** Extend `reminderService.js` or backend logic.
- **Add more filters/search:** UI and API are ready for further enhancements.
